RedHood is a test on Unreal Engine 5's 2D capabilities.
This game is a 2D side scroller dungeon crawler with basic functionality.
All assets are free and can be used commercially.

The end result should have the following:
- Main Menu with Settings menu.
- Pause Menu
- Basic Interaction System for Doors utilizing Interfaces
- Enemy AI
- Health Bars
- Basic Combat Melee/Ranged
- Multiple Levels
- Save System
- Loading of any level after completion from the Main Menu
